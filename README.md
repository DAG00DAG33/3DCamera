# 3DCamera
A CAD dessign I have done to enable any camera to take 3D stereoscopic photos and videos.
With some mirrors it divides the photo into two photos separated by some distance. This creates the 3D stereoscopic effect.

The phone version works perfectly.
The camera version has some trouble with the camera autofocus.
The Yi version is for a go pro like camera named Yi, but the dessign is unfinished.
